### Web Dev Survey App

This application is a timed survey game. The user begins the survey and answers a series of multiple choice questions. When the user begins the survey, a timer set to 60 seconds begins to count down to zero. For an incorrect answer selection, the user is penalized by removing 5 seconds from the countdown timer. After all questions have been answered by the user, a final score page is shown to the user, where the player's score equals the amount of time still left in the countdown timer. The goal of the survey game is to finish with the highest score. The user will be presented with an input box to enter their initials. Upon clicked the 'submit' button, the user's initials and corresponding score will be stored in localStorage, and added to the High Score page, which can be viewed by clicked the link in the top left corner of the application window.
